# Of Wireless Mice and Men

I consider Software Engineering and Architecture both a Science and an Art. I enjoy writing both software and literature. My firm belief is that works in both areas should be well-oragnized, clean, beautiful, serve a purpose and leave the reader/user wanting more.

I am currently seeking internships/employment with the main purpose of exposing myself to professionals who are good at what they do, love it, and can help me polish my talent to become a great Software Engineer/Architect.


## 2017 Road Map
Outside of working full-time as a Front-End Developer, I will be following this road map on side projects:

* Achieve ultimate mastery of JavaScript and AngularJS by teaching them to UCF students and freecodecamp members. Absolutely Free.
* Serve as code mentor and PM for the members of KnightJS. 
* Personal Learning dedicated to:

	* RabbitMQ
	* Redis
	* Advanced MongoDB
	* Docker
